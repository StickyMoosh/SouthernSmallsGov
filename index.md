## Welcome to The Official website of the Republic of Southern Smalls.

This is for our [Discord Server](https://discord.gg/B9qtuwY), which is the first actual democracy in the Biggie Smalls empire.

### Presidential Statement

Our recently elected President and Founder, StickyMoosh, has recently released a statement about his goals for this server.

```markdown
“I had this idea for a pure democracy when I ran for 
presidency on the Republic of Biggie Smalls, a server 
that I was one of the founders of, and I got my role 
removed and I was moved into prison. After that, I 
made my own server where we would actually have free 
speech, and so far, I think it’s going pretty well.”

### Suggestions

Is something in our country not going the way you'd like? Is there an issue you'd like to fix? Well, our nation has institued a **#suggestions** channel, making us the first server to do so!
Don't worry, giving a suggestion against a leader won't send you to jail, like in past servers. If it is a reasonable request, the government will try to fulfill it as much as they can.
