## Welcome to The Official, Government-Made Website for the Republic of Southern Smalls.

This is for our [Discord Server](https://discord.gg/B9qtuwY), which is the first actual democracy in the Biggie Smalls empire.

Whenever you commit to this repository, GitHub Pages will run [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) to rebuild the pages in your site, from the content in your Markdown files.

### Markdown

Markdown is a lightweight and easy-to-use syntax for styling your writing. It includes conventions for

```markdown
“I had this idea for a pure democracy when I ran for 
presidency on the Republic of Biggie Smalls, a server 
that I was one of the founders of, and I got my role 
removed and I was moved into prison. After that, I 
made my own server where we would actually have free 
speech, and so far, I think it’s going pretty well.”
```

For more details see [GitHub Flavored Markdown](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/).

### Jekyll Themes

Your Pages site will use the layout and styles from the Jekyll theme you have selected in your [repository settings](https://github.com/StickyMoosh/SouthernSmallsGov/settings). The name of this theme is saved in the Jekyll `_config.yml` configuration file.
